# Asset Self Reporting SnipeIT
A script to compile an assets information and update SnipeIT inventory system.

This is a script I use in my environment to automatically update all domain assets daily to my SnipeIT Inventory System and manage certain aspects of the assets based on information the script finds in the inventory system.

Sensitive information and some functions have been removed which may cause some errors in a few functions. You will need to modify this for you environment. 

# Customization

Place config.ps1 in the same directory as this script, with the following parameters completed.

$snipeiturl = "https://your.snipeit.url"
$snipeitapi = "your.snipeit.apikey"
